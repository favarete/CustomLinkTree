One of the\nmost profound minds of the twenty century, best known as the father of\ntheoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Turing always showed signs of his above-average intelligence. In addition,\nhe was an avid reader of physics and math books. In one of his articles,\npublished at the age of 24, he talked about computable numbers; it was in\nthis article that he devised a mechanical process that could tell when a\nlogical procedure could be proven or not. This procedure is known today as\nthe Turing Machine, a hypothetical device that would change roles as needed.\nWe learned some of the fundamental logic of algorithms from this machine.\nWe also learned what would become all the modern computing we know today.</p>\n<p>Another impressive achievement he is remembered for is the techniques for\nspeeding the breaking of German ciphers during the second world war. Turing\nplayed a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled\nthe Allies to defeat the Nazis in many critical engagements. Some historians\nestimated that his work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years\nand saved over 14 million lives.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Science is a differential equation. Religion is a boundary condition.</p>\n<p>— Alan Turing - Epigram to Robin Gandy (1954)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another well-known fact about Turing is when he almost married a teammate,\nbut she chose not to move on when he told her he was gay. Later, in 1952,\nafter having his home broken into by a friend of a man with whom he became\ninvolved, he reported the case to the police. He was arrested after admitting\nhis sexual orientation to the authorities and tried under the Labouchere\nAmendment of 1885, which considered it illegal to be homosexual. Possibly\nbecause of his importance to the government, he was offered freedom on the\ncondition that he undergo “treatment” with injections of synthetic estrogen,\nchemical castration with a female hormone that caused several side effects.\nTuring ended up accepting.</p>\n<p>Two years after this event, Turing was found dead of cyanide ingestion. He\nwas only 41 years old and allegedly poisoned an apple and ate to end his own\nlife after being persecuted for being gay, losing his job, and financial\nconditions. However, some people, among them Turing’s mother, argue that he\nprobably accidentally poisoned himself while dealing with chemicals in his\nhome laboratory and deny that his death was by suicide.</p>\n<p>It was only in 1967 that the laws of the United Kingdom stopped making\nhomosexuality a crime. However, it was only in 2017 that a law lifted the\nconviction of all those unjustly persecuted men before the end of the\nhomophobic legislation. The “Turing law” was named after the most famous\nvictim of institutionalized homophobia in England.</p>\n<p><em>Rodrigo Favarete</em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/cyber-defence/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cyber Defense","date":"20 May, 2021","description":"This piece shows Alan Turing, English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.
