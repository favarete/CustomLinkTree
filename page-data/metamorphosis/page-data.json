He was\ncommercially unsuccessful during his lifetime, and he was considered a\nmadman and a failure.</p>\n<p>In short, we can say that Vincent was ahead of his time even in his mental\nconditions since today we face more and more problems with depression,\nanxiety, and other diseases considered the <em>diseases of modernity</em>. It\nwas also typical that he would often neglect his physical health, eat\nproperly, and drink heavily.</p>\n<p>He started painting later in his life, when he had 27 or 28 years, after\nfailing at multiple other jobs. Then, after a tormented life that led to\nisolation, he died virtually anonymously by shooting himself in the chest.\nThere was still an attempt to help him, but he could not resist the wounds.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we only know of his life because of the roughly 750 letters he wrote\nto his brother Theo, with whom he had a gigantic connection, and because of\nhis sister-in-law, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, who did everything she could to promote\nhis work after his death.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you hear a voice within you say ‘you cannot paint,’ then by all means\npaint, and that voice will be silenced.</p>\n<p>— Vincent van Gogh - Letter to Theo van Gogh (28 October 1883)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Van Gogh’s life makes me think about the place of art today. How many people,\nhow many great artists are creating unique concepts but are still, and will\nalways be, unknown, lost in some social media, ignored by the algorithms and\nby the galleries. We are constantly trying to make something meaningful in\nour modern world, with our work lost in the middle of tons of artificial\ncontent. Van Gogh was ignored and underestimated by the galleries and artists\nof his time. It seems to be the fate for most artists even today in this era\nof communication filled with plastic information.</p>\n<p><em>Rodrigo
