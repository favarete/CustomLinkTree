She died in relative obscurity.</p>\n<p>Camile faced many difficulties throughout her life, even being barred from art\nschools such as the École des Beaux Arts just for being a woman. But, without\ngiving up, she ended up studying at one of the few spaces that accepted women\nat the time, the Académie Colarossi. And in 1882, she managed to set up a studio\nwith other women and produced her first sculptures.</p>\n<p>One of her mentors was Auguste Rodin, another sculptor. She began a problematic\nrelationship with him in 1884 but never actually lived with him, who only used\nher as a model and lover, always reluctant to end her twenty-year relationship\nwith Rose Beuret. The relationship ended in 1892, but her reputation was still\nassociated with the image of the sculptor. She left the relationship with an\nintense depression that accompanied her throughout her life. The end also caused\nher to suffer massive boycotts in the artistic scene, which led her to increase\nisolation and poverty.</p>\n<p>Camille was a genius of sculpture but only received due recognition after her\ndeath. The end of her life was in a psychiatric hospital, hospitalized by her\nfamily, who claimed she was demented for destroying many of her works and acting\nparanoid, accusing Rodin of stealing her ideas and leading a conspiracy to kill her.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am scared; I don’t know what is going to happen to me. What was the point\nof working so hard and of being talented, to be rewarded like this?</p>\n<p>— Camile Claudel (1864 - 1943)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The hospitalization took place after her father’s death in 1913. Perhaps he was\nthe only person in her family who approved her career choice and helped her in\nsome way throughout her life, besides supporting her financially several times.\nThe hospital management stated several times that the artist could return to\nsocial life because she was lucid, although she had mental outbursts. Still,\nher mother always refused to release her and forbade her to receive visits or\neven correspondence from someone who wasn’t her brother, the very one who had\ncommitted her. Some historians speculate that her brother, also an artist, felt\novershadowed by Camile’s art and used his internment to get her out of his way.</p>\n<p>She was an artist crushed by the society of her time. It’s unfortunate to know\nthat, despite the achievements of women in the last century, we are still in a\nsexist world where it is common to see women living similar problems like the\nones in Camiles’ life. It is also fair to think that many of these stories are\nhidden, a lot of these stories are happening right now, but we will never know.</p>\n<p><em>Rodrigo Favarete</em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/prison/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Prison","date":"12 May, 2021","description":"This piece shows Camile Claudel, a French sculptor, best known for her bronze and marble depictions of figures.
